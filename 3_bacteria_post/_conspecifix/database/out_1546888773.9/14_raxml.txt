Option -T does not have any effect with the sequential or parallel MPI version.
It is used to specify the number of threads for the Pthreads-based parallelization

RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 49 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
undetermined columns removed is printed to file concat85.fa.reduced
